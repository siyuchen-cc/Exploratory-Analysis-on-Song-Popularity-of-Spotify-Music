# Exploratory-Analysis-on-Song-Popularity-of-Spotify-Music

### Motivation

Iâ€™m a music lover and curious about what makes certain types of songs popular. Therefore, this project focus on the popularity of songs among different genres on Spotify. I want to firstly identify the most popular genres on Spotify during year 2018 and 2019, and then understand if popularity is related with certain types of song characteristics.
I will focus on three main problems and some auxiliary problems based on them.
1. How do the popularity vary by different song genres like pop, rap, hip-hop, rock, etc.
For this part, I will review the distribution of song popularity in general and also by genres and find the most and least popular genre.

2. Can we perform a linear regression model based on the songs attributes to predict the popularity? For this part, I will look at 13 song characteristics and build linear model based on those features to predict the popularity of songs. I also use PCA analysis to further explore the song popularity.

3. Can we find representative clusters for songs?
I will use K-means clustering to find representative clusters to identify different song features.

### Data Source
I will be using a csv file from Kaggle: https://www .kaggle.com/zaheenhamidani/ultimate-spotify-tracks-db.
